.SH NAME
scr_check_complete \- checks whether a flushed SCR checkpoint set is complete and valid

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "scr_check_complete <checkpoint_dir>"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBscr_check_complete\fR command checks whether the files in a
checkpoint directory on the parallel file system constiture a complete
and valid set.  It rebuilds missing checkpoint files if there is sufficient
redundant file data.  It writes an \fIscr_summary.txt\fR file, which is
used by the SCR library to fetch and redistribute files to appropriate
ranks upon a restart.
.LP
The command requires a single parameter that specifies the checkpoint
directory (not the prefix directory) on the parallel file system where
the checkpoint file set was written to.
.LP
One may invoke the command outside of a SLURM job allocation, which is
useful to check and rebuild a checkpoint set in which \fBscr_postrun\fR
may have failed to complete its internal call to \fBscr_check_complete\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
(1) Check and rebuild missing checkpoint files in a checkpoint directory:
.nf
>> scr_check_complete /p/lscratchb/username/run1/checkpoints/current
.fi
