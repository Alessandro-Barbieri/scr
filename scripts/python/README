Python equivalents of perl/bash scripts in ../{common,SLURM,LSF}

(Initial / tentative stage)

Leaving defined vars, e.g., '@X_LIBDIR@', as they are where they appear for now.
(Including these in strings as if they were valid text)
The sample compile.py would go through python files and replace occurrences of these vars.

Beginning by looking at SLURM+LSF

Some external execs should be replaced by calls to Python methods
The scr_run currently looks much better in bash.

Classes / collecting values+methods will come as scripts more complete

Verbose tracing function, and program exec function could be made common
