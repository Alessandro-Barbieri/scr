There are 2 ways to use the testing scripts in this directory.

The first way is to use fully automated testing.

To use fully automated testing, simply run the
   BUILD_AND_TEST
bash script with a single argument, the file to which you want output written.
The BUILD_AND_TEST script will build SCR and run the TEST python script as a batch job, which will parse the output and determine whether or not the test was passed.
The last thing printed into the output file will be whether the test passed or failed.
If the output file is a relative path, the path will be interpreted relative to the examples directory, found at $SCR_INSTALL/share/scr/examples

To use interactive testing, run the
   BUILD_FOR_TESTING
bash script with a single argument, the maximum length of the interative testing session.
The BUILD_FOR_TESTING will build SCR and open an mxterm allocation on 4 nodes for testing.

Testing commands to copy into the interactive testing session can be found in the
   TESTING.sh
and
   TESTING.csh
scripts. These scripts are identical except for language. The TESTING.sh script is for bash users, and the TESTING.csh script for csh users.
These commands are not required for interative testing, but if executed in the presented order represent the same tests as the automated TEST script.
It is also possible to run the automated TEST python script from an interactive testing session.

If you have any problems running these tests, email scalablecr-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net for assistance.
