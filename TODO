Sort of.  There is a really old version of pdsh that we use at
/admin/bin/pdsh.  There is a really old version of dshbak at
/admin/scripts/dshbak2.  There is IBM's version of dshbak at
/usr/bin/dshbak.

Someday I hope to compile the latest pdsh (which includes dshbak) for
AIX, but it just hasn't happened yet.
